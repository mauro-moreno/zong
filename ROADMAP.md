# Zong Roadmap

**Vision.** A clean, educational Pong clone in Zig + Mach; tiny codebase; cross-platform desktop.

## Near-term releases
- **v0.1.0 — Playable core** (M1–M6): 2-player, scoring to 11, stable physics.
- **v0.2.0 — UX & SFX** (M7–M8): bitmap score, basic audio, small polish.
- **v0.3.0 — Single-player** (M9): AI with difficulty presets.
- **v1.0.0 — Polish & Packaging** (M10): options, neat defaults, tagged release.

## Stretch ideas
Replay seed logging, particles/trails, online (later), web build when Mach’s web path is stable.

## Contributing quickstart
See `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Look for issues labeled **good first issue** and **P1**.
